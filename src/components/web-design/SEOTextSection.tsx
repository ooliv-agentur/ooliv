          <p className="my-4">
            As a web design agency in Mainz, we develop websites that not only look good but also function effectively: technically, content-wise, legally, and strategically. 
            Our clients come to us when templates are no longer sufficient, when loading times are too long, or when a relaunch needs more than just a new screen design.
          </p>
          
          <p className="my-4">
            With a systematic approach, we create custom websites that make your brand visible, measurably perform, and can grow long-term. 
            From the concept presentation to technical implementation, we deliver WordPress web design solutions that are structured, secure, and search engine-friendly.
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Custom Website Instead of Templates – Why Standard Solutions Are Not Enough</h3>
          
          <p className="my-4">
            Many businesses start with themes or page builders – and fail when it comes to scaling, security, or brand impact. 
            Our answer: tailor-made web design with concept, intuitive user guidance, and clean code structure.
          </p>
          
          <p className="my-4">We consider:</p>
          
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 my-4 space-y-2">
            <li>Your brand identity and target audience</li>
            <li>Your technical requirements (e.g., corporate website with CRM integration)</li>
            <li>Your existing infrastructure (hosting, CMS, domain)</li>
            <li>Your online marketing goals (leads, visibility, conversion)</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p className="my-4">We focus on consistent design logic, structured content models, and complete SEO integration.</p>

          <p className="my-4">
            We work with contemporary web technology that is scalable, maintainable, and future-proof. 
            Whether you rely on WordPress, TYPO3, or a custom HTML setup – we develop CMS-based websites 
            that make it easy to update, structure, and extend content.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Data Protection, GDPR and Technical Security</h3>
          
          <p className="my-4">
            Legal security is non-negotiable. Our web solutions meet GDPR requirements – from protecting personal data 
            to complete technical security.
          </p>
          
          <p className="my-4">Our standards:</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">SEO & Online Marketing: Visibility as a Strategy</h3>
          
          <p className="my-4">
            A website is only as good as its findability. That's why search engine optimization (SEO) is part of our web design process – 
            complemented by online marketing measures.
          </p>
          
          <p className="my-4">Our SEO strategy:</p>
          
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 my-4 space-y-2">
            <li>Keyword strategy based on search volume & competition</li>
            <li>OnPage optimization: titles, meta, H1-H6, ALT texts</li>
            <li>Technical SEO: page speed, crawling, clean URL structure</li>
            <li>Local SEO: for regional visibility (e.g., "Web Design Mainz")</li>
            <li>Link building & content seeding after launch</li>
            <li>Expandable through: Google AdWords (SEM) & performance campaigns</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p className="my-4">Whether SEO-ready websites, conversion funnels, or data-driven campaign setups – we build websites that are visible and remain so.</p>
