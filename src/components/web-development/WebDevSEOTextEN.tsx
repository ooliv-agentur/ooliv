          </p>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Programming Languages and Technologies We Master</h3>
          
          <p className="my-4">
            At ooliv, our developers are fluent in all major programming languages essential for powerful web development:
          </p>
          
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 my-4 space-y-2">

            .NET and C# for robust enterprise solutions, PHP and WordPress for content-driven sites, Node.js for high-speed real-time apps, and Python for scalable back-end systems. Ruby and Perl provide powerful scripting options, while Lua is ideal for lightweight, embedded use cases.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Web Development vs. Web Design: Understanding the Difference</h3>
          
          <p className="my-4">
            Web development and web design serve distinct purposes:
          </p>
          
          <p className="my-4">
            Web Design focuses on aesthetics, user interface, and brand storytelling.
          </p>
          
          <p className="my-4">
            Web Development ensures that those designs function flawlessly with front-end and back-end programming.
